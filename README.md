# lang-php

lang-php has js functions for php like getElementById() or alert();

to import the file download it or copy the code then use the include function in your php to get the file so like:

    include 'js-php.php';
    
the coolest and probably the most useful thing in lang-php is the getElementById() function

Ive went through every single forum for a getElementById function in php but nothing was found so i developed my own and it was really simple this is how u use it
    
    html:
        <textarea id="what">hello</textarea>
    php:
        getElementById("what", "value") //its like doing document.getElementById("what").value but in php
    



then you can use the js functions in php :)
